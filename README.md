# Small-game-in-python-
It's a little game, when you're alone...

Make a order on visual studio code with the name "Game", in the order you put the code, the name of the code is "RGame.py" for RealGame, and than "Run Python File in Terminal" and than the "RGame" make 2 files with the name "money.json" and "users.json" there you can see all.

The Admin account is:
name: admin
password: admin123

and there you can change all.

Thanks :)
